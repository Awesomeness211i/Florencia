# Florencia-Engine
My Attempt at making my own game engine from scratch in c++. It is taking some concepts from TheCherno's game engine series when I am not sure how I might implement something and trying to implement it myself as well as I can without much help.

# Building Instructions
Right now I only have visual studio supported I might use cmake or premake or something else later to help build to other projects but for now I just have the .sln file.
